# CHIP-8

Interpreter written for the CHIP-8 virtual machine.

## TODO

- [x] consider using a RNG instead of the [fair dice roll](https://xkcd.com/221/).
- [x] timers don't do anything right now and they probably should.
- [ ] the sound instruction should play sounds.
- [x] interactivity should be implemented.
